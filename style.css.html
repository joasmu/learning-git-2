  <p> We give our best that's too good for the enviers
Seems like it's not good enough
Life is so hard and when you're the best fighter
It's like a curse you're being attacked

Pressure around you, within you, it tears you
Let's find a key screams your soul
Is this a nightmare, no it's reality
Sometimes we could fall apart - apart</p>
